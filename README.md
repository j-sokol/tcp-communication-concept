Robot moves across city. The city consists of 2-D panels with (x,y) coordinates. There are no physical obstacles in the city. The robot can go forth, turn to the left or pick up flag. It is also capable of informing about its city position.

The robot can move just across the city panels, if it gets out of the city it crashes immediately. The city dimensions are 37 x 37. Both these coordinates (x and y) must be within <-18,18> range.

There is a flag at the (0,0) position. The robot's mission is to get at the flag's position, pick it up and read the secret text.
